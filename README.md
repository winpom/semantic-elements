# Horiseon - Digital Marketing Solutions

## Description

The new and improved Horiseon website, now with optimized code. Previously, the CSS and HTML of this site was redudant, inefficient, and used outdated terms and elements that would weaken its position within search engine results. Now, with this improvement, these issues should be largely resolved, resulting in a site that runs more efficiently, will show better in SEO, and is significantly easier for future coders to work on.
